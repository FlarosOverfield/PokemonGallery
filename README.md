# Pokemon-Gallery

A collection of sprites, artwork, and other assets from generation 1 to 7, ran through PNGOptimizer, mostly for preservation. 
Github cannot display more than 1000 files in one folder from the web browser, so you will have to use Github Desktop or use clone to see every single file.
Make sure you have at least 5GB of free space even if the repository is much smaller.

This repository would have never been possible without https://github.com/Taicanium/DreamDownloader, go star it now you blithering witless dishcloth
